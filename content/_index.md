# Who Am I?

<br>

From a young age, I've been captivated by the intricate workings of systems. This passion led me on a deep dive into the world of operating systems, and currently, I'm fascinated by the very foundation – the Linux Kernel. Understanding its inner workings isn't just an intellectual pursuit; it fuels my desire to build and optimize systems at a fundamental level.

My 1.5 years as a Systems Administrator have been instrumental in shaping my practical skills. However, the hunger to learn and lead pushed me further. Today, I wear the proud hat of Systems Lead at IRIS, NITK. This role allows me to leverage my experience not just for individual tasks, but to guide and collaborate with a team. I thrive in environments that foster innovation and teamwork, where we can collectively achieve greater things.

Beyond the realm of systems administration, a new horizon beckons – the world of DevOps. I'm deeply intrigued by its potential to revolutionize software development workflows. The idea of bridging the gap between development and operations, streamlining processes, and achieving continuous delivery excites me. My understanding of the Linux Kernel, the backbone of most infrastructure, positions me well to contribute effectively in this exciting space.

However, my skillset doesn't stop there. I possess prior experience in developing mobile applications using Flutter. This foray into the world of app development has instilled in me a well-rounded perspective. It allows me to approach problems from different angles, considering both the infrastructure and the user experience.

I consider myself a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new avenues to expand my knowledge. The ever-evolving tech landscape is a playground for me, and I'm eager to stay ahead of the curve by actively acquiring new skills and expertise.

In essence, I'm a passionate individual with a strong foundation in systems administration, a thirst for knowledge about the Linux Kernel, and a vision shaped by the possibilities of DevOps. I bring a collaborative spirit, a well-rounded skillset, and a relentless drive to learn and contribute to the ever-changing world of technology.
